                            There’s something about the African wilderness, the stillness, the skies, the stars that
                            turns every moment into something unforgettable. Whether you're just beginning your life
                            together or celebrating a milestone, a couple’s safari in Africa is more than a holiday,
                            it’s an experience that draws you closer.

                        <p className="pt-3">You're waking up to the soft rustle of the wind through the trees, your
                            partner still wrapped in sleep beside you. Outside, the sky is turning the softest shade of
                            pink. You sip coffee in silence, watching elephants move through the morning mist, no
                            noise, no rush, just presence.</p>
                        <p className="pt-3">
                            Later, it's just the two of you, alone in the wild, chasing golden light on an evening game
                            drive. And when night falls? You're wrapped in a blanket by the fire, stars spilling across
                            the sky like confetti, your fingers intertwined, no words needed.
                        </p>
                        <p className="pt-3 font-medium text-black">
                            This is what it feels like to fall in love again, with them, with the moment, with life.
                        </p>

                            Let’s be honest, life gets loud. Kids, work, bills, routines.
                            But out here? There's only wind through the grass, firelight, and each other.
